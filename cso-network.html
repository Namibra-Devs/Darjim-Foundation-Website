          <p class="highlights">
            It is important to note that since its inception, a great amount of
            progress has been made especially in the area of
            <span class="blue">agriculture</span> to help curb the troubling
            unemployment that the local people has to contend with. Key Thematic
            Areas are indicated below:

          <h1>Sustainable Agriculture and Food Security</h1>
          <p class="food-paragraph">
            East Mamprusi and Bunkpurugu Nankpanduri Districts in particular has
            a vast stretch of land with lots of potential when tapped to the
            full (est.) will save the people from the acute poverty and its
            attendance challenges. In terms of climatic conditions, the area is
            more favourable for crop production and yet the people cannot
            produce enough to feed themselves throughout the year not to talk of
            selling to others. Dajrim Foundation is therefore working to improve
            on food production and alternative income generating activities:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>1. Processing, storage, Marketing and Nutrition</li>

            <li>3. Advocacy for improve Agricultural Development</li>

        <div class="goal-outline">
          <h1>Women And Children Rights And Education</h1>
          <p class="food-paragraph">
            Women have been treated as people with no rights, whose place is in
            the” kitchen”, especially in Africa, Ghana, and the northern regions
            in particular. Opportunities are therefore not shared evenly among
            both sexes. This is demonstrated in areas such as the ownership of
            productive resources, school attendance, credit worthiness, etc.
            These facts could be attributed to low enrolment in school, early
            marriages, domestic violence, and socio- cultural beliefs and
            practices. We aspire to give women a say in the making of strategic
            decisions, giving them the opportunity to own productive resources
            and create the awareness of sending both the boy and girl child to
            school. We will improve women’s credit worthiness through the
            formation of small groups to access credit from financial
            institutions and other
