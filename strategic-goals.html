        <h1>The Foundation and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</h1>
        <p>
          Dajrim Foundation is a passionate believer in the global goals being
          the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Though a lot of progress
          have been made in various areas towards the achievement of the
          Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a lot more needs to be done
          especially in many developing countries such as Ghana. To be able
          achieve the global goals, collective actions are needed to be taken by
          UN Member countries as a sign of genuine and representative country
          ownership of the seventeen (17) identified goals and their specific
          targets. As an organization we have and would continue to engage key
          stakeholders to discuss and identify development challenges,
          potentials, and opportunities for transformation of communities
          through sustained actions for growth..

            equal share in the improved conditions resulting from Socio-Economic
            Development.

            contributions from stakeholders, especially the Local authorities
            including the District Assembly and associated Non-Governmental
            Agencies like churches and other religious bodies to lift them out
            of poverty and raise the standard of living of the vulnerable
